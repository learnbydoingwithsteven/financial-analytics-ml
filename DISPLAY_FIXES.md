# Display Issues Fixed

## 🎯 Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. ✅ Technical Indicators Overlay Not Showing

**Problem**: When clicking "Show Indicators" button, the SMA lines and buy/sell signal markers were not appearing on the price chart.

**Root Cause**: Using `dataKey={() => sma20}` with Recharts Line component doesn't work for constant values. Recharts expects data points for each x-axis value.

**Solution**: Changed from `Line` component to `ReferenceLine` component for horizontal indicator lines:

```jsx
// Before (not working):
<Line dataKey={() => sma20} stroke="#f59e0b" />

// After (working):
<ReferenceLine 
  y={sma20} 
  stroke="#f59e0b" 
  strokeDasharray="5 5"
  label={{ value: `SMA 20: ${sma20.toFixed(2)}`, position: 'insideTopRight' }}
/>
```

**Result**: 
- ✅ SMA 20 displays as orange dashed horizontal line
- ✅ SMA 50 displays as purple dashed horizontal line
- ✅ Both show current values as labels
- ✅ Buy/sell signal markers appear as colored dots

### 2. ✅ Model Specifications Panel Empty

**Problem**: When clicking "View Model Specifications & Training Details", the panel showed empty or no content.

**Root Cause**: The `model_specs` data is only available after training models, but there was no helpful message explaining this to users.

**Solution**: Added conditional rendering with helpful instructions:

```jsx
{!rankedModels[0]?.model_specs ? (
  <div className="text-center py-8">
    <Info className="h-12 w-12 mx-auto mb-3" />
    <h4>Model Specifications Not Available</h4>
    <p>To view detailed model specifications, please retrain the models...</p>
  </div>
) : (
  // Show actual specs
)}
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Clear message when specs not available
- ✅ Instructions on how to get the specs
- ✅ Specs display properly after training
- ✅ Shows dataset info, hyperparameters, and features

---

### 3. ✅ ML Predictions Timeout Error

**Problem**: ML Predictions section showed generic error: "timeout of 60000ms exceeded"

**Root Cause**: Predictions API times out when models haven't been trained yet, but the error message wasn't user-friendly.

**Solution**: Enhanced error handling with actionable guidance:

```jsx
if (error) {
  return (
    <div className="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-lg p-6">
      <AlertCircle className="h-12 w-12 text-yellow-600 mx-auto mb-4" />
      <h3>Predictions Not Available Yet</h3>
      <p>The prediction request timed out. This means models need to be trained first.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>1. Click "Train Models & Generate Predictions"</li>
        <li>2. Wait 30-60 seconds</li>
        <li>3. Predictions appear automatically</li>
      </ol>
      <button onClick={handleTrainAndPredict}>Train Models Now</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Friendly error message instead of technical jargon
- ✅ Step-by-step instructions
- ✅ Quick action button to start training
- ✅ Explains the 30-60 second wait time
