## 💡 Pro Tips

### Model Specifications
1. **More samples = better**: Look for 400+ training samples
2. **Check test split**: 80/20 or 70/30 is standard
3. **Feature count**: 15-25 features is typical for time series
4. **Compare hyperparameters**: See why one model outperforms

### Signal Markers
1. **Look for clusters**: Multiple signals at same point = stronger
2. **Check confidence**: >60% is strong, <50% is weak
3. **Combine with SMA**: Price above both SMAs = bullish
4. **Historical context**: See if signals were accurate in past

### Combined Analysis
1. **Technical first**: Check chart signals
2. **ML second**: Verify with predictions
3. **Specs third**: Validate model quality
4. **Risk management**: Never rely on single indicator
