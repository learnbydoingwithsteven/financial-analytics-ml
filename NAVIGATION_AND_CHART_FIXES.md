# Navigation & Chart Display Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Prophet & LSTM Missing from Historical Chart
**Problem**: Sample Historical Prediction chart only showed 3 models (Ensemble, XGBoost, Random Forest)
**Missing**: LSTM and Prophet predictions

### Issue 2: No Way to Return to Future Predictions
**Problem**: After viewing future predictions, clicking "Back to Backtest Results" removed ability to return
**Issue**: Had to re-run predictions to see them again

---

## 🔧 Solutions

### Fix 1: Add All 5 Models to Historical Chart

**File**: `frontend/src/components/AdvancedBacktesting.jsx` (lines 301-302)

**Added**:
```jsx
<Line type="monotone" dataKey="lstm_pred" stroke="#ef4444" strokeWidth={1.5} name="LSTM" strokeDasharray="3 3" />
<Line type="monotone" dataKey="prophet_pred" stroke="#3b82f6" strokeWidth={1.5} name="Prophet" strokeDasharray="3 3" />
```

**Now Shows**:
- ━━━ Black: Actual prices
- - - Purple: Ensemble predictions
- - - Orange: XGBoost predictions  
- - - Green: Random Forest predictions
- - - Red: LSTM predictions ✨ NEW
- - - Blue: Prophet predictions ✨ NEW

### Fix 2: Add Prophet to Future Predictions Chart

**File**: `frontend/src/components/AdvancedBacktesting.jsx` (line 427)

**Added**:
```jsx
<Line type="monotone" dataKey="prophet_pred" stroke="#3b82f6" strokeWidth={2} name="Prophet (Future)" strokeDasharray="3 3" dot={false} />
```

### Fix 3: Smart Navigation System

**File**: `frontend/src/components/AdvancedBacktesting.jsx` (lines 344-359)

**Before**:
```jsx
// Only had back to config button
<button onClick={() => { setStage('config'); setBacktestResults(null); }}>
  ← Back to Configuration
</button>
```

**After**:
```jsx
// Now has BOTH buttons when future exists
<div className="flex items-center justify-between">
  <button onClick={() => { setStage('config'); setBacktestResults(null); setFutureResults(null); }}>
    ← Back to Configuration
  </button>
  {futureResults && (
    <button onClick={() => setStage('future')} className="text-green-600">
      View Future Predictions →
    </button>
  )}
</div>
```

**Also Fixed** (line 433):
```jsx
// Don't clear futureResults when going back
<button onClick={() => setStage('results')}>  // Was: setFutureResults(null)
  ← Back to Backtest Results
</button>
```

## 🔄 New Navigation Flow

### Before (Limited)
```
Config → Backtest → Results → Future Predictions
  ↑                   ↑            ↓
  └────[Back]─────────┴─────[Back (lost future)]
```

### After (Full Navigation)
```
Config → Backtest → Results → Future Predictions
  ↑         ↑         ↑ ↓            ↓
  └─[Back]──┴────[Back]┴[View Future]┘
```

### Complete Navigation Options

**From Config Stage**:
- [Run Historical Backtests] → Go to Results

**From Results Stage**:
- [← Back to Configuration] → Go to Config (clears all)
- [View Future Predictions →] → Go to Future (if exists)
- [Predict Future Prices] → Generate and go to Future

**From Future Stage**:
- [← Back to Backtest Results] → Go to Results (keeps future)

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

### Color Scheme (Consistent Across Both Charts)

| Model | Color | Hex | Stroke |
|-------|-------|-----|--------|
| **Actual** | Black | #000000 | Solid (2px) |
| **Ensemble** | Purple | #8b5cf6 | Dashed 5-5 |
| **XGBoost** | Orange | #f59e0b | Dashed 3-3 |

### Navigation Button Styling

```
← Back to Configuration
   ↑ Blue text (go back, reset everything)

View Future Predictions →
   ↑ Green text (go forward, preserve state)

← Back to Backtest Results
   ↑ Blue text (go back one step)
```

## 💡 User Workflow Improvements

### Scenario: Finding Best Model

**Old Workflow**:
```
1. Run backtest
2. See results (only 3 models in chart)
3. Click predict future
4. Want to check Prophet's metrics
5. Go back (lose future predictions)
6. Check metrics
7. Have to re-run prediction ❌ (30-60s wait)
8. Finally can compare
```

**New Workflow**:
```
1. Run backtest
2. See results (all 5 models in chart) ✨
3. Already see Prophet performance ✨
4. Click predict future
5. See all 5 future predictions ✨
6. Go back to check exact metrics
7. Click "View Future Predictions →" ✨
8. Instantly return to chart ✨
Total time saved: 30-60 seconds
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### State Management
```javascript
// State variables
const [stage, setStage] = useState('config');
const [backtestResults, setBacktestResults] = useState(null);
const [futureResults, setFutureResults] = useState(null);

// Navigation preserves state
// Going from future → results: futureResults kept
// Going from results → future: just change stage
// Going to config: clear everything
```

### Chart Data Mapping
```javascript
// Historical chart data includes all models
chartData = [{
  date: "2025-10-01",
  actual: 8.25,
  ensemble_pred: 8.24,
  xgboost_pred: 8.26,
  random_forest_pred: 8.23,
  lstm_pred: 8.27,      // ✨ NEW
  prophet_pred: 8.25    // ✨ NEW
}, ...]

// Future chart data includes all models
futureData = [{
  date: "2025-11-01",
  ensemble_pred: 8.30,
  xgboost_pred: 8.32,
  random_forest_pred: 8.29,
  lstm_pred: 8.35,      // Already had
  prophet_pred: 8.28    // ✨ NEW
}, ...]
```
